# Object_Detection
Object Detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos. 
Given an image or a video, the goal of object detection is to recognize and locate objects of interest.

There is a variety of techniques to perform object detection. Popular approaches are deep learningâ€“based approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as R-CNN Model Family (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN) and YOLO Model Family (YOLO, YOLOv2 or YOLO9000 and YOLOv3).
